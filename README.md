# XCropper

The recently popular 'Tap the post' trend on [X](https://x.com/wolfyxbt/status/2012900327968632864)

It involves splitting images into multiple segments and uploading them to create a puzzle-like effect. I made a small tool using Codex — X Cropper — which can automatically crop your images to X's compatible dimensions. Feel free to give it a try.
